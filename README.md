# SPARQL

This repository contains some query examples that I have prepared while learning SPARQL

- The Wars of The Roses stores some queries about people related to The Wars of the Roses.

These queries can be tested using the Wikidata Query Service: https://query.wikidata.org
I also recommend to consult the Wikidata SPARQL tutorial: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial
In case you need to check properties or entities, the Advanced Search of Wikidata is also very useful:https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&profile=advanced
